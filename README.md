# Technology Data

The Danish Energy Agency publishes catalogues of technology data for energy technologies. Technology Data provides information about technology, economy and the environment for several energy installations and is used by the Danish Energy Agency for energy projections.

### About
To assess developments in the climate and energy sector, there is a need for techno-economic data for a range of technologies. These data are compiled in Technology Catalogues, published and regularly updated by the Danish Energy Agency. The data in the Technology Catalogues represents general representative techno-economic values for technologies. The assumptions in the Technology Catalogues should not be the basis for final specific investment decisions. In specific projects, there may be significant variations from the data provided in the Technology Catalogues, so specific assessments of costs and other factors should be made for a given single project whenever possible. The Technology Data of technologies relevant to municipal heat planning (kollektiv varmeforsyning) shall be used for project assessments if obtaining and documenting more specific or comparable offers or key figures from similar ongoing projects is impossible. This is described in more detail in the Guidance to socioeconomic analyses on energy. Find the guideline on the subpage of Socio-economic Assessments.

The Technology Catalogues cover existing technologies, technologies under economic and technological development as well as technologies at the experimental stage, with emphasis placed on the first two categories. 
Using the Danish Energy Agencyâ€™s model for calculating the levelized cost of electricity (LCoE) it is possible to compare costs across different technologies.
